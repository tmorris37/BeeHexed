### Building software 

Unity automatically builds the software. Go to:

1. File -> Build Settings
2. Select the scenes you want to build
3. Select the correct OS version
4. Build and Run

### Testing software 

There are a couple of options for testing the software. When you push to a branch, tests are automatically run. The other way to run tests is within Unity. Unity has a built in test-runner which can be found by going to Window on the top bar and clicking on the General subfolder. From here, individual tests can be run. Simulations of the game can be individually tested by selecting a scene, and then clicking the play button at the top of the screen. Not all scenes currently work

### Adding tests 

You can add new tests straight in Unity, as we are using the Unity testing suite. In the assets folder, proceed to the tests folder. In there there are multiple scripts which contain tests. If the tests you want to add are relevant to the name of any of the existing scripts, add your tests there. To create a new testing file, and name it describing what tests you will be running. Please name using the camelcase format. Use the previous scripts as reference if need be. 

### Building release 

[CI Tool : Github Actions](https://github.com/tmorris37/BeeHexed/actions)

In order to create a build of the game, in Unity go to file, and then build and run. From there you can choose where you want the build of the game to be stored on your computer.
